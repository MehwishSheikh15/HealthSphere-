/**
 * @fileOverview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for most data, with some public read access where appropriate.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.  Only the user can read/write their own profile.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Stores doctor profile information. Only the doctor can read/write their own profile.
 * - /appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointment information.  Access is controlled by patientId and doctorId.
 * - /transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction information. Access is controlled by patientId and doctorId.
 * - /wallets/{walletId}: Stores wallet information for doctors. Only the associated doctor can read/write.
 * - /reminders/{reminderId}: Stores reminders. Only the user associated can read/write.
 * - /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}: Stores subscription information. Only the user associated can read/write.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Doctors and Users are treated similarly, with owner-only access to their respective profiles.
 * - The rules explicitly deny any operation not specifically allowed.
