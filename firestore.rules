/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for HealthSphere application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data,
 * and a public-read, owner-write model for certain collections.  It leverages
 * denormalization to avoid complex `get()` calls in rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information, accessible only to the user.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Doctor profile information, accessible only to the doctor.
 * - /appointments/{appointmentId}: Appointment data, accessible with role-based access control.
 * - /transactions/{transactionId}: Transaction data, accessible with role-based access control.
 * - /wallets/{walletId}: Wallet data, accessible only to the doctor.
 * - /reminders/{reminderId}: Reminder data, only the user may access it.
 * - /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}: Subscription data, only the user may access it.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for user and doctor profiles.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *   The rules assume that any data needed for authorization checks (e.g., user roles,
 *   ownership) is denormalized directly onto the documents being secured. This avoids
 *   costly `get()` calls.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *   User profiles and doctor profiles are stored in separate collections to enforce
 *   different access control policies.
