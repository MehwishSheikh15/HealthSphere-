/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for HealthSphere application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure-by-default posture, restricting data access unless explicitly permitted. It focuses on user-ownership and role-based access control, leveraging Firebase Authentication for identity verification. The rules are written to be auditable and maintainable, abstracting complex logic into helper functions.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Stores doctor profile information, publicly readable but writable only by authenticated doctors.
 * - /appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointment information, restricted to participating users (doctor or patient).
 * - /transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction information, restricted to participating users (doctor or patient).
 * - /wallets/{walletId}: Stores doctor wallet information, accessible only to the doctor.
 * - /reminders/{reminderId}: Stores reminders for users, accessible only to the user.
 * - /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}: Stores subscription information for users, accessible only to the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Read-only collections are explicitly marked to prevent accidental writes.
 * - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is to deny access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `appointments` collection relies on the `doctorId` and `patientId` fields to determine access, avoiding potentially costly `get()` calls.
