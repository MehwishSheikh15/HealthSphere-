/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for HealthSphere application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data,
 * with additional separation between user and doctor profiles. Public read access
 * is not generally allowed, except where explicitly noted.  The rules are designed
 * to prevent unauthorized data access and modification, focusing on protecting
 * user privacy and data integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, where {userId} is the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Stores doctor profiles, where {doctorId} is the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointment data, with `patientId` and `doctorId` fields.
 * - /transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction data related to appointments, with `patientId` and `doctorId` fields.
 * - /wallets/{walletId}: Stores wallet information for doctors, where {walletId} likely corresponds to the doctorId.
 * - /reminders/{reminderId}: Stores reminders, associated with a `userId`.
 * - /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}: Stores subscription data for users, associated with a `userId`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No public listing of users or doctors.
 * - Strong ownership enforcement: Users can only access their own data.
 * - Doctor and User profiles are completely segregated.
 * - Roles are managed client-side using Firebase Auth tokens.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Doctor and Patient IDs are included directly in the `appointments` and `transactions` documents.
 *   This avoids the need for complex `get()` calls to verify user roles or relationships when
 *   securing these collections.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User and doctor profiles are stored in separate top-level collections (`/users` and `/doctors`).
 *   This prevents accidental exposure of sensitive doctor information to regular users or vice versa.
