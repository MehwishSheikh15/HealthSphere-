/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for HealthSphere application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure, owner-only access model for user-specific data and a shared access model for collaborative data.
 * It focuses on preventing unauthorized data access and modification. Data schema validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profile information, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Doctor profile information, accessible only to the doctor themselves.
 * - /appointments/{appointmentId}: Appointment information, accessible to the patient and doctor involved.
 * - /transactions/{transactionId}: Transaction information, related to appointments and accessible to the patient and doctor involved.
 * - /wallets/{walletId}: Wallet information for doctors, accessible only to the doctor themselves.
 * - /reminders/{reminderId}: Reminders for users, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}: Subscription information for users, accessible only to the user themselves.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Strict user-ownership for user-related data (profiles, reminders, subscriptions).
 * - Shared access for appointments and transactions, based on doctorId and patientId.
 * - No public listing of user-related collections (users, doctors, reminders, subscriptions).
 * - Open reads with owner-only writes are not implemented due to the absence of clear owner fields in the entity definitions.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Appointment documents contain both `doctorId` and `patientId` to allow for direct authorization checks without additional reads.
