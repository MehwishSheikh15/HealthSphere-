/**
 * @file Overview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for `users`, `doctors`, `wallets`, `reminders`, and `subscriptions`.
 * Appointments and transactions have an access control model where only the patient and doctor should be able to get access to the resources.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the authenticated user with matching UID.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Stores doctor profiles, accessible only to the authenticated doctor with matching UID.
 * - /appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointment data, accessible to both the patient and the doctor involved in the appointment.
 * - /transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction data related to appointments, accessible to the patient and doctor.
 * - /wallets/{walletId}: Stores wallet data for doctors, accessible only to the doctor.
 * - /reminders/{reminderId}: Stores reminders for users, accessible only to the user.
 * - /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}: Stores subscription data for users, accessible only to the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 * - Doctors can only manage their own profiles and wallets.
 * - Patients and doctors can only access appointment and transaction data related to themselves.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Doctor verification status could be denormalized into appointments to avoid get() calls.
