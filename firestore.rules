/**
 * @file Overview
 *
 * @core-philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data and separates doctor data for independent management.
 * Users can only read/write their own data. Doctors data is publicly readable but only create/update/deleteable by backend services (or with more sophisticated role-based access in the future).
 *
 * @data-structure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores personal user data, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Stores doctor profile data, publicly readable.
 * - /appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointment data, related to users and doctors.
 * - /transactions/{transactionId}: Stores transaction data related to appointments.
 * - /wallets/{walletId}: Stores wallet data for doctors.
 * - /reminders/{reminderId}: Stores reminders data for users.
 * - /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}: Stores subscriptions data for users.
 *
 * @key-security-decisions
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 * - Doctor profiles are publicly readable to facilitate discovery, but write access is heavily restricted.
 * - Default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * @authorization-denormalization N/A
 * @structural-segregation User and Doctor data are stored in separate top-level collections.
